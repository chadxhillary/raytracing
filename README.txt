## TO RUN

* Open the terminal / Command prompt and navigate to this folder
* enter `q1` followed by a scene number (0-7)
* Add the command line arguments:
  * `-b` to turn OFF motion blur (Speeds up render time substantially)
  * `-aa` to turn OFF antialiasing (Speeds up render time)
  * `shader` to turn ON a non-realistic fragment shading effect

EXAMPLE: 
From the /build directory:
`q1 1 -b -aa shader`
`q1 2 -b`
etc.

## Image Loading:
* stb_image, a public domain image loading library by Sean Barrett. (https://github.com/nothings/stb)
